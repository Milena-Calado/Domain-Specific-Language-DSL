# Blockly 

Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.

**The project page is https://developers.google.com/blockly/**

Blockly has an active [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/blockly). Please drop by and say hello. Show us your prototypes early; collectively we have a lot of experience and can offer hints which will save you time. We actively monitor the forums and typically respond to questions within 2 working days.

Help us focus our development efforts by telling us [what you are doing with
Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/registration). The questionnaire only takes
a few minutes and will help us better support the Blockly community.

## Releases

We release by pushing the latest code to the master branch, followed by updating our [docs](developers.google.com/blockly) and [demo pages](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com). We typically release a new version of Blockly once a quarter (every 3 months). If there are breaking bugs, such as a crash when performing a standard action or a rendering issue that makes Blockly unusable, we will cherry-pick fixes to master between releases to fix them. The [releases page](https://github.com/google/blockly/releases) has a list of all releases.

Releases are tagged by the release date (YYYYMMDD) with a leading '1.' and a trailing '.0' in case we ever need a major or minor version (such as [1.20190419.0](https://github.com/google/blockly/tree/1.20190419.0)). If you're using npm, a specific release can be installed by using its tag: `npm install git://github.com/google/blockly.git#1.20181219.0`
